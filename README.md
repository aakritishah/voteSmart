# voteSmart
## overview
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project, “voteSmart” is aimed to help the users of this application (US citizens) to easily connect with political candidates that best fit their personal views. When the application first opens, users will be greeted with a short survey so that the application can compute how this user aligns with different parties and local candidates. This application will concisely state a party’s platform to the user, in comparison with other parties. If a user is not interested in taking the survey, they can skip it and continue to view the party’s platforms. This will be presented in a way that is easily understood by the common person so that the user can compare a candidate's views against others and make a sound decision based on their views. As an added feature, the application will include a database with all the voting locations where the user can input their location and search for which location, they want to vote in. I determined that one of the main reasons for the recent downturn in US voter turnout is a lack of proper education on current political platforms. The main purpose of this application is to altruistically help potential voters to make the voting decision that is the truest to their values; these educational resources could increase not only a voter’s confidence in their participation in democracy but also the number of citizens who vote.
